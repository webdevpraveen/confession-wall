# Anonymous Confession Wall (Realtime)

A real-time anonymous platform where people can share thoughts, confessions, and emotions without login, identity, or permanence.

This project focuses on **psychological safety**, **simplicity**, and **live interaction** rather than profiles, followers, or algorithms.

---

##  Project Vision

Many people especially students have thoughts they cannot easily express in public or on traditional social media.

This project aims to create a **low-pressure digital space** where:
- identity is not required
- content matters more than the person
- expression feels safe and temporary
- interactions happen live, not through endless scrolling

The goal is not to build another social network, but a **shared moment wall**.

---

##  Current Status

This project is in **early development**.

Right now, the focus is on:
- defining the core idea clearly
- building a stable real-time foundation
- keeping the system simple and understandable

Features will be added incrementally and intentionally.

---

##  Core Idea

- Users open the site
- They write a confession or thought
- The message appears instantly for everyone online
- No login, no username, no personal data

Each message exists on its own, not attached to an identity.
